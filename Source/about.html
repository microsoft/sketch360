    <h1>Sketch 360</h1>
    <h6>A Microsoft Garage Project</h6>
    <p>
        With Sketch 360, you can create 360 degree panoramic sketches from a
        single point looking in all directions.  360 cameras save these spherical
        images in a flat JPEG images by using an equirectangular projection and
        added specific metadata to the images identifying them as 360 photos.
        Sketch 360 saves files in the same way so the sketches can be viewed as 360
        photos on sites like Facebook, Adobe Lightroom.com, and Kuula.co.

    <h2>Using Sketch 360</h2>
    <p>
        Sketch 360 has two primary surfaces, a drawing canvas, and a 360 view.  You
        draw on the canvas with a pen or touch and every time a stroke is added,
        the 360 view is updated, rotating to the end point of the ink stroke.  At
        any time you can rotate the 360 view with your finger to see other views of
        the sketch.
    </p>
    <h2>Drawing and Erasing</h2>

    </ol>
    <p>
        With a device that supports a stylus like the Microsoft Surface Duo or the
        Samsung Galaxy Note, you draw with the pen and manipulate the position and
        zooming of the canvas with your touch.  On non-stylus aware devices, you
        can switch to touch-drawing mode to interpret finger touches as pen or eraser strokes instead of panning and zooming.  In addition to using a pinch gesture to zoom, you can use the zoom slider.
    </p>
    <p>
        If using a stylus with an eraser end like the Surface Pen, you can erase any stroke by dragging the stylus over it.  If you are using touch, then press the eraser button to switch to erasing mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help with connecting the left and right edges of a drawing in the 360 view, you can see a little bit of the opposite drawing edge when drawing close to the left or right edge of the drawing canvas.
    </p>
    <p> In the 360 view, press the <b>tilt &amp; rotate</b> button to enable the device's gyroscopic sensor to determine the camera's tilt and rotation.</p>
    <h2>
        Pen Color and Thickness
    </h2>
    <p>
        To the side of the drawing canvas, you can tap on the color button or the thickness button to change the color or thickness of the ink that is created.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Undo and Redo
    </h2>
    Any drawing or erasing can be undone or redone easily by tapping the undo and redo buttons.
    <h2>
        Drawing View and 360 View
    </h2>
    Switch to the drawing view or 360 view modes to only show one of the two panes.  Navigate back in the app to go back to the two-pane view.
    <h2>
        Orthogonal Guidelines
    </h2>
    <p>
        Turning on the orthogonal guidelines helps you draw lines that align with the primary axes in the equirectangular grid.  If you are facing the center point of the drawing canvas.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Red lines go from your front to your back.</li>
        <li>Blue lines go from your left to your right.</li>
        <li>Green lines go from the top to the bottom.</li>
        <li>The Two-point stencil helps you draw lines intersecting any two 
        points. To position it, drag the two circles to reposition them and the
        draw the line over the dashed stencil curve. This stencil was built in 
        collaboration with Ant�nio B. Ara�jo at Universidade Aberta in Portugal.

    <h2>About Sketch 360</h2>
    <p>
        Sketch 360 was originally created by Michael Scherotter and
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2018/11/finally-a-way-to-sketch-360-degree-vr-scenes/">
            released as free app
        </a> built for Microsoft Surface in the
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sketch-360/9p89s2qlh11t">
            Windows Store
        </a> in 2018 to help him create 360 sketches.  Here are some
        <a href="https://adobe.ly/2UMv7Ew">examples of sketches</a>
        he drew with it using Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Go tablets.
        Michael has been <a href="https://adobe.ly/2GpnWYN">
            sketching and keeping journals
        </a> for thirty years ever since he
        started studying architecture in college.  He made his career in
        software development, with a specific passion for building creative
        tools but never stopped sketching.
        Sketch 360 for the Android was built by Microsoft employees, Michael Scherotter, Matthew Leibowitz, Shane Neuville, and Komal Priya in
        company-wide hackathons run by the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/">Microsoft Garage</a>.
